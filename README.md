# 🌟🎄🌟 Advent of Code 2021 🌟🎄🌟
This is my personal collection of answers to the 2021 edition of Advent of Code.

This may not be the best code, or fastest code, but it's mine!

Each day is separated into different folders. Depending on the day's problem, different technologies will be used. I tend to favor JS and C#, but don't think I won't break out something like SQL or Powershell.

Read and run this code at your own risk :D

Merry Christmas!
